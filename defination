Blocks
This category represents individual blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain:
block_height: The sequential number of the block in the blockchain (starting from 0 for the genesis block)
block_hash: The unique identifier for the block, generated by hashing the block's header
miner_address: The Bitcoin address of the miner who successfully mined this block
block_size: The size of the block in bytes
num_transactions: The total number of transactions included in this block
total_fees: The sum of all transaction fees paid to the miner in this block
Transactions
This category tracks individual Bitcoin transactions:
tx_hash: The unique identifier for the transaction
from_address: The sending Bitcoin address
to_address: The receiving Bitcoin address
amount_btc: The amount of Bitcoin transferred
fee_btc: The transaction fee paid to miners
confirmations: The number of blocks that have been mined since this transaction was included in a block
UTXO Data
UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) represents Bitcoin that hasn't yet been spent:
utxo_hash: The unique identifier for this unspent output
address: The Bitcoin address that owns this UTXO
amount_btc: The amount of Bitcoin in this UTXO
spent_status: Whether this UTXO has been spent or remains unspent
spend_tx_hash: If spent, the transaction hash that spent this UTXO
Mempool
This category contains transactions waiting to be confirmed and included in a block:
tx_hash: The unique identifier for the pending transaction
size_bytes: The size of the transaction in bytes
fee_btc: The transaction fee offered to miners
fee_per_byte: The fee rate (fee divided by size), important for prioritization
timestamp: When the transaction was first seen by the network
Miner Metrics
This category tracks statistics related to Bitcoin mining activity:
hashrate: The computational power of the Bitcoin network (typically in hashes per second)
difficulty: The network-wide setting that determines how hard it is to mine a block
block_reward: The amount of new Bitcoin awarded to miners per block
miner_revenue_usd: The total value of block rewards and fees earned by miners, converted to USD
A block in a blockchain is a fundamental unit of data structure that contains a collection of transactions and other information. Think of a blockchain as a digital ledger made up of a continuous chain of these blocks.
Here's what a block typically contains:
Block Header: Contains metadata about the block, including:
A reference to the previous block (previous block hash)
A timestamp
A nonce (a random number used in the mining process)
The merkle root (a hash representing all transactions in the block)
Transaction Data: A list of all transactions included in this block. In Bitcoin, these are records of value transfers between addresses.
Block Hash: A unique identifier generated by hashing the block's contents. This becomes the "previous block hash" for the next block, creating the chain.
Each block is cryptographically linked to the previous one through the inclusion of the previous block's hash, forming a chain that cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks. This property makes blockchains highly resistant to modification of data.
In Bitcoin specifically, new blocks are created through a process called mining, where computers compete to solve a cryptographic puzzle. The winner gets to add the next block to the chain and receives newly minted bitcoin as a reward.
The immutable chain of blocks creates a trustless, decentralized system where participants can verify the entire history of transactions without needing to trust any central authority.
